                  <h3 id="q1">What is the MSRP?</h3><br>
                  For most people, price is a driving factor in choosing which car to purchase. If you see a model you like,
                  ask the dealer what the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) is, which is also called the sticker
                  price.
      
                  The MSRP is the sale price of the vehicle, and it reflects the trim level, entertainment systems, safety
                  features, and more. By asking for the MSRP upfront, you can quickly decide if the car is a realistic choice
                  or not. <br>
                  <br>
      
                  <h3 id="q2">What other fees are included in the sale price?</h3><br>
                  Many car shoppers don’t realize that the MSRP of the vehicle isn’t the final price. When you see the final
                  contract, you’ll notice additional fees tacked on, like a documentation fee, dealer preparation fee, and
                  sales tax.
      
                  To avoid sticker shock, ask the dealer upfront what other fees you’ll have to pay if you purchase the
                  vehicle. <br>
                  <br>
      
                  <h3 id="q3">Is there are warranty?</h3><br>
                  Most new cars have a warranty that’s included with the purchase price of your vehicle. This is called a
                  manufacturer’s warranty or factory warranty. The factory warranty sometimes includes a bumper-to-bumper
                  warranty and a powertrain warranty.
      
                  These plans cover the most important parts and systems in your vehicle, like the engine, steering system,
                  and transmission, which can save you money on repairs if something goes wrong. However, these warranties are
                  usually limited, either to a certain number of years or miles. <br><br>
      
                  <h3 id="q4">What is the car’s safety rating?</h3><br>
                  Most new cars have the latest safety features and technology, like lane departure alerts and forward
                  collision detection. However, it’s a good idea to ask the dealership to review the car’s safety features and
                  pull up the car’s safety rating.
      
                  Organizations like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the National Highway Traffic Safety
                  Administration (NHTSA) publish crash test ratings for many vehicle makes and models. Review the scores for
                  the cars you’re interested in and avoid models with poor ratings.</p>
